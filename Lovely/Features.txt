from playing other games, specifically saints row 3 and skyrim, the features i wish existed to foster a more full world are...

-more interactive npc
once npc's join your faction, hang at your house or know you, theyll aknowledge your presance. This is as simple as saying "hey" and looking at you every now and again. Skyrims thing where people just randomly walk up to you to talk is too much. You should have to build a rapport with someone before theyll talk to you spontaneously or regularly. Other than that just like the real world, people will only really talk to you to negotiate something like a sale or to say excuse me or the max theyll say is "hey" or nod. Clubs, social gatherings, and events are an exception. The people you do know should occasionally introduce you to other people.

-more interactive buildings
every shop, every apartment in every hirise, every closet should be able to be gone into. Theyll be procedurally generated and probably not have much interesting in them, but just the fact that you can enter makes the world seem more open.

-famous people in a variety of fields should exist and have houses there. Interacting with them should be a significant media event

-link to real world (could be immersion breaking)
radios play songs from your MyMusic folder, cinemas play videos from your MyMovies folder etc

-certain cloths are REALLY expensive, just like real life. 

-People occasionally go pee, sleep, or eat

-potion brewed help you progress faster

-dress your followers

-hotter people are less apt to stay and talk to you. people are less likely to talk to you in general if you're dirty. If youre bloody, people will actively avoid you.

-some version of social media where you can keep track of the people you actually know, and the specific stats of their personalities, i.e. likes roses, hates dogs, birthday aug 14 etc

-people speak a different language so player doesnt have to sit through repetitive everyday chatter. When player is among friends, or npc's are around friendly npc's, they will just begin to chat by themselves. There wont be subtitles for this chatter. When it comes time for the missions or stuff the player needs to understand, itll have subtitles

-buying properties and businesses should unlock new gameplay, even if just a minigame

-specialty vehicles and uniforms should unlock new gameplay where you are able to impersonate that figure, ie pose as a police man and do police missions, pose as an ice cream man and sell ice cream.

-interactive items shsould be interactive. the gym should let you work out, the fridge should let you get food, the couch should let you sit, the stripper pole should let you strip
