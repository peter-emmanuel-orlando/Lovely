todo: 
	-make rigidbody control rotation instead of navagent
	-transition abilities away from ienumerators
	-make PrefabPool return an instance rather than the actual prefab
	-make PrefabPool hold copies of instantiated prefabs so theres no need to go creating and destroying them all the time
	-generalize range attacks to thrownprojectiles and beam projectiles
	-make jumping and climbing not just teleport directly to the apropriate spot
	-make kunai apply effects when colliding with a hitbox as well as a physical object

fixed error where exiting an overlapping compound trigger in modularnavmesh would kick agent from the navmesh. This was accomplished by keeping count of how many times agent has crossed into trigger area, and subtracting how many time agent has left trigger area

added in cube debug shape
changed debug shapes to be rendered without constantly creating and destroying gameobjects
changed modular nav mesh class private class AreaOverlap to keep track of a new private class AreaTracking, which keeps the navarea and overlap count together in one class. Class was chosen over struct because of constant updates to overlapCount
