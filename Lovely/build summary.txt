todo: 
	-make rigidbody control rotation instead of navagent
	-transition abilities away from ienumerators
	-make PrefabPool return an instance rather than the actual prefab
	-make PrefabPool hold copies of instantiated prefabs so theres no need to go creating and destroying them all the time

partial: make abilities implement events based on normalized time returned from animation enumerator

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
added fight system design document into fightArena folder along side build summary

many bugfixes
added ScheduledActionsQueue class which prevents mutating queue and sorts scheduledActions

made PowerUpEffects class cleaner and it disposes of itself when appropriate
in Body class, all changes to empowermentLevel variable now go through either the Empower() method or the ConsumeEmpowerment() method, though the actual changing of the variable value happens in the OnEmpowermentLevelChange() method so that base classes could interrupt message.

 A system where the method "public bool ConsumeEmpowerment( int levels)" was considered but dismissed due to it not being in line with the fight system design document, and it making it harder for player to know which attack would execute.
