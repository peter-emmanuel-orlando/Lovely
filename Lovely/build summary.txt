todo: 
	-make rigidbody control rotation instead of navagent
	-transition abilities away from ienumerators
	-make PrefabPool return an instance rather than the actual prefab
	-make PrefabPool hold copies of instantiated prefabs so theres no need to go creating and destroying them all the time
	-generalize range attacks to thrownprojectiles and beam projectiles
	-make jumping and climbing not just teleport directly to the apropriate spot

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

many bugfixes
Jumping is now based on physics and NavMesh.SamplePosition. this makes jumping onto surfaces much smoother

jumping and climbing onto a ledge is also partially implemented via the same method
