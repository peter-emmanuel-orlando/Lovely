	-make rigidbody control rotation instead of navagent
	-transition abilities away from ienumerators
	-make PrefabPool return an instance rather than the actual prefab

	-make jumping and climbing not just teleport directly to the apropriate spot
	-make kunai apply effects when colliding with a hitbox as whel as a physical object
