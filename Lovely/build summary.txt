todo: 
	-make rigidbody control rotation instead of navagent
	-transition abilities away from ienumerators
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
begun transition away from using ienumerators for frame by frame status reporting for methods.
Previously body returned an IEnumerator<float> and the object getting the enumerator would
call movenext each frame to get the progress on how far along the animation was in normalized time.
Now body returns a "PlayToken" object with the method " float GetProgress()" which will give the
normalized time representing how far along the animation is. If the animation is not queued or in
progress, the function returns -1. This may be what they call a "magic number" which i hear is bad 
practice, I dont know.

partial: make abilities implement events based on normalized time returned from animation enumerator
