todo: 
	-make rigidbody control rotation instead of navagent
	-transition abilities away from ienumerators
	-make PrefabPool return an instance rather than the actual prefab
	-make PrefabPool hold copies of instantiated prefabs so theres no need to go creating and destroying them all the time
	-generalize range attacks to thrownprojectiles and beam projectiles
	-make jumping and climbing not just teleport directly to the apropriate spot
	-make kunai apply effects when colliding with a hitbox as well as a physical object
