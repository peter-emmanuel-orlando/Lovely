todo: 
	-make rigidbody control rotation instead of navagent
	-transition abilities away from ienumerators
	-make PrefabPool return an instance rather than the actual prefab
	-make PrefabPool hold copies of instantiated prefabs so theres no need to go creating and destroying them all the time

partial: make abilities implement events based on normalized time returned from animation enumerator
