	-generalize range attacks to thrownprojectiles and beam projectiles
	-make jumping and climbing not just teleport directly to the apropriate spot
	-add directional poise to unifiedcontroller
	-make kunai apply effects when colliding with a hitbox as well as a physical object

welcome back me! this is why its so important to have a job you love. This current job is taxing on your soul, I havent seen you in a while, bud.

Downloaded and tested a few environments with gaia, bloating the size of each zip, but massively improving look of terrain

dumped AI scripts from fightfightfight in, but did not yet combine with current scripts
