todo: 
	-make rigidbody control rotation instead of navagent
	-transition abilities away from ienumerators
	-make PrefabPool return an instance rather than the actual prefab
	-make PrefabPool hold copies of instantiated prefabs so theres no need to go creating and destroying them all the time
generalize range attacks to thrownprojectiles and beam projectiles

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fixed many embarassing errors in prefabPool
fixed bug where thrown projectiles wouldnt hit
fixed bug where anified controller starting off at a rotation other than (0, 0, 0) would cause the camera to go crazy
added in thrown projectiles as opposed to beam projectiles
added in the MusicPlayer class, which plays sounds recieved by the new AudioSpeaker class.
the musicPlayer synchronises sound for all its speakers
