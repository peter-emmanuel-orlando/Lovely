todo: 
	-make rigidbody control rotation instead of navagent
	-transition abilities away from ienumerators
	-make PrefabPool return an instance rather than the actual prefab
	-make PrefabPool hold copies of instantiated prefabs so theres no need to go creating and destroying them all the time
	-generalize range attacks to thrownprojectiles and beam projectiles
	-make jumping and climbing not just teleport directly to the apropriate spot
	-add directional poise to unifiedcontroller
	-make kunai apply effects when colliding with a hitbox as well as a physical object

edited BUT DID NOT TEST scripts imported from fightfightfight.

Added in a sun/moon/sky changing system for night day cycle with multiple directional lights and ambient lighting contribution
(probably added in prev version)

changed Being class from fightfightfight to Body or Mind classes where appropriate.

added in TrackedObject instead of TrackedGamObject so gameobjects can be tracked without having to inherit from class.
	TODO! make only monobehaviors implementing the interfaces "derived" from ISpawnable (i.e. ISpawnableFood, ISpawnableBody, etc)
	trackable, to prevent a tracked thing not being found because its tracked as something else.

Changed intel class to be more in line with more extendible implementation from FightFightFight

Changed Mind into two classes,
	MindBase is responsible for ticking through performables, and managing the source of performables ONLY
	Mind is responsible for perception of the outside world, and categorizing those things into friend/foe/food etc
